Instead, comfort-focused (palliative) care should be instigated if the baby survives labour and birth when the prognosis is likely to be poor or an advance care directive is in place.

                "GPT-4-0_answer": "There is no visual graph, but textual criteria include: no heart rate, no respiratory effort (support may still be attempted); under 22 weeks (no resuscitation); 22+ weeks (thermal and respiratory care); <60 bpm after ventilation (limited escalation for <24 weeks).",

                "notes": "Good call on absence of graph. You could have added that escalation is based on heart rate, gestational age, and response to interventions as per text."

                "answer": "• An early pre alert call should be made to the receiving location to enable a team to be ready for the baby and the parents.",
                "GPT-4-0_answer": "Early decisions, such as performing an early pre-alert call to the receiving hospital, directly enhance transport readiness by ensuring that appropriate neonatal and maternal teams are prepared on arrival. Decisions on whether to initiate survival-focused or comfort-focused care also influence the urgency and configuration of transport resources, including whether to send a second crew or prioritize facilities with neonatal and maternal co-location.",
                "rating": 75,
                "notes": "You correctly identified a key element—early pre-alerts—but the answer is limited in scope. It doesn't fully cover other downstream impacts like appropriate destination selection, preparing neonatal expertise, or deciding on the transport crew configuration based on maternal and infant stability. A broader view would have increased the score."
